A mighty fortress is our God
1.
A mighty fortress is our God,
A bulwark never failing;
Our helper he, amid the flood,
Of mortal ills prevailing.
For still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and power are great,
And, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.
2.
Did we in our own strength confide,
Our striving would be losing;
Were not the right man on our side,
The man of God's own choosing.
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is he;
Lord Sabaoth his name,
From age to age the same,
And he must win the battle.
3.
And though this world, with demons filled,
Should threaten to undo us;
We will not fear, for God hath willed
His truth to triumph through us.
The prince of darkness grim,
We tremble not for him,
His rage we can endure,
For lo! His doom is sure,
One little word shall fell him.
4.
That word above all earthly powers,
No thanks to them abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Through him who with us sideth.
Let goods and kindred go,
This mortal life also;
The body they may kill;
God's truth abideth still,
His Kingdom is for ever.

Before Jehovah's awful throne,
Ye nations bow with sacred joy;
Know that the Lord is God alone;

Made us of clay, and formed us men;
And when like wandering sheep we strayed,
He brought us to his fold again.

We'll crowd thy gates with thankful songs,
High as the heavens our voices raise;
And earth, with her ten thousand tongues,
Shall fill thy courts with sounding praise.

Vast as eternity thy love;
Firm as a rock thy truth shall stand,
When rolling years shall cease to move.

Eternal God, our song we raise
1.
Eternal God, our song we raise
In thankful, overflowing praise,
For men of faith whose power was thine,
Whose love no barrier could confine;
They humbly offered Christ their bread,
And lo, the multitudes were fed!
2.
We thank thee for the fruitful years,
The sacred gains of toil and tears,
For mighty works through weakness wrought,
For souls who led in deed and thought;
They followed Jesus in the light
And their loud anthems thrilled the night.
3.
O may no longing of our own
Obscure the path by Jesus shown!
We would not thirst for earth's reward
And lose the blessing of our Lord:
His cup of pain and grief and strife
That yieldeth up the gift of life.
4.
Our Father, we beseech thee now:
Receive again our first pure vow
To stand though fire and tempest rage,
Nor fear the terrors of our age,
To love thee with a constant mind
And lose ourselves to save mankind.
5.
Our great Redeemer liveth still,
His love sustains us in thy will
Because he conquered, we shall win,
His cross before, his joy within;
Our cheerful banners are unfurled,
For Christ has overcome the world.

Whose hands all things created,
Who holds the countless stars;
Enthroned in heavenly glory,
Yet not a God afar;
Thou deignest to have dwelling
Here where thy people are.

Forbid that man's achievements
Should cause our faith to wane,
Or seek in human wisdom
Our spirit to sustain;
Lord, surely thou art shaping
All things to thy design,
And born of this conviction
Is faith to match our time.
3.
And in a world divided
By selfishness and guile,
When truth is on the scaffold
And faith is standing trial,
Grant us, by inward knowledge
No learning can bestow,
A faith that answers firmly:
These things, these things I know.
4.
Though men have wrought confusion
Thy hand still holds the plan,
And thou, at length, decideth
The destiny of man;
Dominions rise and perish,
The mighty have their day,
But still thy word abideth,
It shall not pass away.

Nor e'en the praising heart

Of praise in every part!
2.
Praise in the common words I speak,
Life's common looks and tones,
In fellowship at hearth and board
With my beloved ones;
Not in the temple crowd alone
Where holy voices chime,
But in the silent paths of earth,
The quiet rooms of time.
3.
Fill every part of me with praise;
Let all my being speak
Of thee and of thy love, O Lord,
Poor though I be, and weak.
So shalt thou, Lord, from me, e'en me,
Receive the glory due;
And so shall I begin on earth
The song forever new.
4.
So shall each fear, each fret, each care
Be turned into a song,
And every winding of the way
The echo shall prolong;
So shall no part of day or night
From sacredness be free;
But all my life, in every step,
Be fellowship with thee.

God who touches earth with beauty,
Make my heart anew;
With they Spirit recreate me
Pure and strong and true.
Like thy springs and running waters,
Make me crystal pure;
Like thy rocks of towering grandeur,
Make me strong and sure.
2.
Like thy dancing waves in sunlight,
Make me glad and free;
Like the straightness of the pine trees
Let me upright be.
Like the arching of the heavens,
Lift my thoughts above;
Turn my dreams to noble action,
Ministries of love.
3.
Like the birds that soar while singing,
Give my heart a song;
May the music of thanksgiving
Echo clear and strong.
God who touchest earth with beauty,
Make my heart anew;
Keep me ever by thy Spirit
Pure and strong and true.

The little cares which fretted me

The little cares which fretted me,
I lost them yesterday
Among the fields, above the sea,
Among the winds at play;
Among the lowing of the herds,
The rustling of the trees,
Among the singing of the birds,
The humming of the bees.
2.
The foolish fears of what may come,
I cast them all away
Among the clover-scented grass,
Among the new-mown hay;
Among the hushing of the corn,
Where drowsing poppies nod.
Ill thoughts can die, and good be born,
Out in the fields of God.

Sing the praises of his name.

Keep us in the narrow way;

Where no clouds thy glory hide.

Need they no created light;

Stood a lowly cattle shed,
Where a mother laid her baby
In a manger for his bed.
Mary was that mother mild,
Jesus Christ her little child.

He came down to earth from Heaven
Who is God and Lord of all,
And his shelter was a stable
And his cradle was a stall;
With the poor and mean and lowly
Lived on earth our Saviour holy.

And through all his wondrous childhood
He would honor and obey,
Love and watch the lowly mother
In whose gentle arms he lay.
Christian children all must be
Mild, obedient, good as he.

For he is our childhood's pattern;
Day by day like us he grew;
He was little, weak and helpless;
Tears and smiles like us he knew;
And he feeleth for our sadness,
And he shareth in our gladness.

And our eyes at last shall see him
Through his own redeeming love;
For that child so dear and gentle
Is our Lord in Heaven above.

To the place where he is gone.

A light came out of darkness
1.
A light came out of darkness;
No light, no hope had we,
Till Jesus came from Heaven
Our light and hope to be.
Oh, as I read the story
From birth to dying cry,
A longing fills my bosom
To meet him by and by.
Chorus
Shall you, shall I, meet Jesus by and by?
And when we reach the Glory Land,
We'll swell the song of the angel band.
Shall you, shall I, meet Jesus by and by?
2.
How tender his compassion,
How loving was his call,
How earnest his entreaty
To sinners, one and all.
He wooed and won them to him
By love, and that is why
I long to be like Jesus,
And meet him by and by.
3.
Yet deeper do I ponder,
His cross and sorrow see,
And ever gaze and wonder
Why Jesus died for me.
And shall I fear to own him?
Can I my Lord deny?
No, let me love him, serve him,
And meet him by and by.

They shall drink abundantly.

Of the Babe of Bethlehem,
Who was worshiped by the angels
And the wise and holy men
How he taught the learned doctors
In the temple far away?
O I'm glad, so glad to tell you,
He is just the same today!

To his dear disciples tossing
On the waves of Galilee?

Quickly did his will obey?
O I'm glad, so glad to tell you,
He is just the same today!
3.
Have you ever heard of Jesus
Praying in Gethsemane,
And the ever-thrilling story,
How he died upon the tree,
Cruel thorns his forehead piercing,
As his spirit passed away?
This he did for you, my brother,
And he's just the same today!
4.
Have you ever heard of Jesus
Who was buried in the tomb,
And was mourned by his disciples
In despair, defeat and gloom?
By the power of God eternal,
He arose on Easter day,
And he lives for our salvation:
He is just the same today!

Thou didst leave thy throne and thy kingly crown

Thou didst leave thy throne and thy kingly crown
When thou camest to earth for me;
But in Bethlehem's home was there found no room
For thy holy nativity.
Chorus
O come to my heart, Lord Jesus;

Heaven's arches rang when the angels sang,
Proclaiming thy royal degree;
But of lowly birth cam'st thou, Lord, on earth
And in great humility.

Thou camest, O Lord, with the living word
That should set thy people free;
But with mocking scorn, and with crown of thorn,
They bore thee to Calvary.

When Heaven's arches ring, and her choirs shall sing,
At thy coming to victory,
Let thy voice call me home, saying: Yet there is room,
There is room at my side for thee!

The Holy Spirit makes him known,
And by his life we all may live.

When Jesus looked o'er Galilee,
So blue and calm and fair,
Upon her bosom, could he see
A cross reflected there?

When sunrise dyed the lovely deeps,
And sparkled in his hair,
O did the light rays seem to say:
A crown of thorns he'll wear?

When in the hush of eventide,
Cool waters touched his feet,
Was it a hymn of Calvary's road
He heard the waves repeat?

Swept from the open plain,
The Master surely heard the song:
The Lord shall live again!

With thorns, thine only crown!
How pale art thou with anguish,
With sore abuse and scorn!
How does that visage languish
Which once was bright as morn!
2.
O Lord of life and glory,
What bliss till now was thine!
I read the wondrous story,
I joy to call thee mine.
Thy grief and thy compassion
Were all for sinners' gain;
Mine, mine was the transgression,
But thine the deadly pain.
3.
What language shall I borrow
To thank thee, dearest Friend,
For this thy dying sorrow,
Thy pity without end?
O make me thine for ever!
And should I fainting be,
Lord, let me never, never
Outlive my love to thee.
4.
Be near me, Lord, when dying;
O show thyself to me;
And, for my succor flying,
Come, Lord, to set me free.
These eyes, new faith receiving,
From Jesus shall not move;
For he who dies believing,
Dies safely through thy love.

'Twas there my Lord was crucified;

And purchased there my pardon free.

It was on the cross he shed his blood,

Where Jesus shed his blood for me.

On Calvary's tree the King of Glory languished
1.
On Calvary's tree the King of Glory languished,
Held not by nails but by undying love,
Sin's debt to pay, the sting of death remove,
Boundless cleansing to provide,
Mercy's gate open wide.
Chorus
From that sacred hill
Hope is gleaming still;
Thy shame and grief he bore;
Go in peace, sin no more.
2.
His purple robe is parted 'mong the soldiers,
That scepter-reed discarded where it fell;
Yet, meekly borne, that crown of cruel thorn
Still attests his royal might,
Fears to quell, wrongs to right.
3.
Darkness descends, the cross in mystery veiling,
Deep thunders roll and lightnings rend the skies
As Jesus dies, a willing sacrifice;
God's own word by blood is sealed:
By his stripes we are healed.
4.
His tender touch can heal the broken-hearted,
His word dispel the darkness of despair;
Come, bring thy sin, thy sorrow, pain and care,
And, believing, thou shalt prove
All the strength of his love.

On the cross of Calvary,
Jesus died for you and me;;
There he shed his precious blood,
That from sin we might be free.
O the cleansing stream does flow,
And it washes white as snow!
It was for me that Jesus died
On the cross of Calvary.

On Calvary, on Calvary!

On the cross of Calvary.

O what wondrous, wondrous love
Brought me down at Jesus' feet!

Asks a sacrifice complete!
Here I give myself to thee,
Soul and body, thine to be;
It was for me thy blood was shed
On the cross of Calvary.
3.
Take me, Jesus, I am thine,
Wholly thine, for evermore;
Blessed Jesus, thou art mine,
Dwell within for evermore;
Cleanse, O cleanse my heart from sin,
Make and keep me pure within!
It was for this thy blood was shed
On the cross of Calvary.
4.
Clouds and darkness veiled the sky
When the Lord was crucified;

1.
Once, on a day, was Christ led forth to die,
And with the crowd that pressed on him joined I.
Slowly they led him, led him to the tree,
And I beheld his hands no more were free.
Bound fast with cords, and this was his distress,
That men denied those hands outstretched to bless.
Chorus
Sacred hands of Jesus, they were bound for me;
Wounded hands of Jesus, stretched upon a tree,
Ever interceding, mercy is their plea.
Their effectual pleading brings grace to me,
Redeeming grace to me.
2.
Hands that were scarred by daily fret and tear;
Hands quick to sooth the troubled brow of care;
Hands strong to smite the sins that men enthrone,
Yet never raised to seek or claim their own:
Dear hands of Christ! and yet men feared them so
That they must bind them as to death they go.
3.
Hands that still break to men the living bread;
Hands full of power to raise again the dead,
Potent and healing, eager to reclaim,
Laid in forgiveness on one bowed in shame;
Say, wouldst thou bind, by pride and unbelief,
Those hands that compass all thy soul's relief?

Others he saved, himself he cannot save
1.
Others he saved, himself he cannot save,
Railed they against him on the cross above;
They were the bondsmen by their pride enslaved:
He was the freeman, bound alone by love.
2.
Others he saved, himself he cannot save;
He was the shepherd, dying for his sheep.
No man can take it, but his life he gave,
From death returning, all his own to keep.
3.
Others he saved, himself he would not save,
Though hosts of angels waited his command;
He marched to victory through an open grave,
Flung wide life's portals with his mighty hand.

Lonely, forsaken, our sinbearer he,
Love to the utmost for my soul he gave;

Whereon the Son of man
Pours out his life for me.
O sin of man! O love of God!

The Saviour asks no tears,
Weep not for me, he cries;
Yet all our broken years
Are mirrored in his eyes.
And all our griefs, including mine,
Go surging through that heart divine.

Fain would I hide mine eyes
From love so torn with pain;
Yet all within me cries
To look, and look again;
I cannot pierce the mystery,
But this I know: he dies for me.

Rings out upon the skies;

He died that we might be forgiven,
He died to make us good,

Saved by his precious blood.

There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin;

And we must love him too,

Didst thou consent to languish in,
That through atoning blood outpoured
Our broken peace might be restored!

We mourn that e'er our hearts should be
One with a world that loves not thee;
That with the crowd we passed thee by
And saw, but did not feel, thee die.
Not till we knew our guilt and shame
Did we esteem the Saviour's name.

Though with our shame we shunned the light,
Thou didst not leave us in the night;
We were not left in sin to stray
Unsought, unloved, from thee away;
For from thy cross irradiates
A power that saves and recreates.

And in thy blood sin's wounds to lave.

Sorrow and love flow mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,

In the garden he prayed, and sweat great drops of blood,
To save a poor sinner like me.

Bloomed a garden, passing fair,
And they laid the Saviour there.

But, afar, his rising sun
Flung a quenchless ray across
To the garden near the cross.

Not for long the grave prevailed;
When the dreary night had paled
Into God's appointed day,
Angels rolled the stone away.
Christ, the Lord of truth and might,
Faring forth in robes of light,
Drove the fearful shades of loss
From the garden near the cross.

We shall pluck the fairest flower
In the sacrificial hour.

Recompense for sufferings,
And the blessing waits for us

Through thy deathless love;
Bring us safe through Jordan

This joyful Eastertide,
Away with sin and sorrow,

Had Christ, that once was slain,
Ne'er burst his three-day prison,
Our faith had been in vain:
But now hath Christ arisen.

My flesh in hope shall rest,
And for a season slumber:

Shall wake the dead in number:

Since Jesus crossed the river;
Lover of souls, from ill
My passing soul deliver.

From pole to pole, that wars may cease

Fair flowers of Paradise extend
Their fragrance ever sweet.

Formed thee for his own abode.

What can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation's walls surrounded,

See, the streams of living waters,
Springing from eternal love,
Well supply thy sons and daughters,
And all fear of want remove;
Who can faint while such a river
Ever flows their thirst to assuage;
Grace which, like the Lord, the giver,
Never fails from age to age?

Saviour, if of Zion's city
I through grace a member am,
Let the world deride or pity,

All his boasted pomp and show;

Kindled in some hearts it is;
O that all might catch the flame,
All partake the glorious bliss.

Small and feeble was his day:
Now the word doth swiftly run,
Now it wins its widening way;

Ever mighty to prevail;

Shakes the trembling gates of Hell.

Before the angry mob and Roman might,
We seek thy courage; make it now our own
That we may stand unflinching for thy right.

0 Christ, who died with arms outstretched in love
For all who lift their faces to thy cross,
Fill, thou, our lives with charity divine,
Till thou and thine are all, and self is loss.

To loose thy living presence on our earth.
Teach us to feel thy greatness till we know,
In life and death, the soul's enduring worth.

O the deep, deep love of Jesus
1.
O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
Vast, unmeasured, boundless, free,
Rolling as a mighty ocean
In its fulness over me!
Underneath me, all around me,
Is the current of thy love;
Leading onward, leading homeward,
To my glorious rest above.
2.
O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
Spread his praise from shore to shore;
How he loveth, ever loveth,
Changeth never, nevermore;
How he watcheth o'er his loved ones,
Died to call them all his own;
How for them he intercedeth,
Watcheth o'er them from the throne.
3.
O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
Love of every love the best;
'Tis an ocean vast of blessing,
'Tis a haven sweet of rest.
O the deep, deep love of Jesus,
'Tis a Heaven of heavens to me;
And it lifts me up to Glory,
For it lifts me up to thee.

O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness
1.
O worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness!
Bow down before him, his glory proclaim;
With gold of obedience, and incense of lowliness,
Kneel and adore him, the Lord is his name.
2.
Low at his feet lay thy burden of carefulness,
High on his heart he will bear it for thee,
Comfort thy sorrows and answer thy prayerfulness,
Guiding thy steps as may best for thee be.
3.
Fear not to enter his courts in the slenderness
Of the poor wealth thou wouldst reckon as thine;
Truth in its beauty, and love in its tenderness,
These are the offerings to lay on his shrine.
4.
These, though we bring them in trembling and fearfulness,
He will accept for the name that is dear;
Morning of joy give for evenings of tearfulness,
Trust for our trembling, and hope for our fear.

Speak my Lord's sincerity.

Tender in my love for men,
Wooing them to God again;
With compassion pure and sweet
Lead the lost to Jesus' feet.

Mighty Spirit, dwell with me;
I myself would mighty be,
Mighty so as to prevail
Where unaided man must fail;
Ever by a mighty hope
Pressing on and bearing up.

Separate from sin, I would
Choose and cherish all things good;
And whatever I can be
Give to him who gave me thee.

I want the gift of power within

Of love, and of a healthful mind;
Of power to conquer inbred sin,
Of love to thee and all mankind,
Of health that pain and death defies,
Most vigorous when the body dies.

When shall I hear the inward voice
Which only faithful souls can hear?
Pardon and peace and heavenly joys
Attend the promised Comforter;
O come, and righteousness divine
And Christ, and all with Christ, are mine!

O that the Comforter would come!
Nor visit as a transient guest,
But fix in me his constant home
And take possession of my breast,
And fix in me his loved abode,
The temple of indwelling God.

Where is the sure, the certain seal
That ascertains the Kingdom mine?
The powerful stamp I long to feel,
The signature of love divine;
O shed it in my heart abroad,
Fulness of love, of Heaven, of God!

Is it nothing to you that one day Jesus came
1.
Is it nothing to you that one day Jesus came
All our sorrow and suffering to share?
He came as the light of new hope for a world
In the day of its darkest despair.
Chorus
Is it nothing to you that his cross speaks our shame?
Is it nothing to you, for whose cleansing he came,
That our guilt made his Calvary and pierced his hands through?
Is it nothing to you? Is it nothing, nothing to you?
2.
Is it nothing to you that one day Jesus gave,
Gave in love of his measureless all?
So richly he poured out his limitless life
When he answered our pitiful call.
3.
Is it nothing to you that one day Jesus died,
That men mocked him and, heedless, passed by?
No sorrow was e'er like the sorrow he bore
When they scorned him and left him to die.
4.
Is it nothing to you that today Jesus saves?
Though we stand all condemned before God
He carries our sin on his own loving heart,
And he saves by his pardoning blood.

We wonder why Christ came into the world
Chorus
He came to give us life in all its fullness,
He came to make the blind to see,
He came to banish death and doubt and darkness,
He came to set his people free.
He liberating love imparted,
He taught men once again to smile;
He came to bind the broken hearted,
And God and man to reconcile.
He came to give us life in all its fullness,
He came to make the blind to see,
He came to banish death and doubt and darkness,
He came to set his people free.
He came to set us free!
1.
We wonder why Christ came into the world
A helpless, homeless child;
We wonder why he tolerated men,
The tainted and defiled.
We wonder why! We wonder why!
The Son of God as man came down;
What does this signify?
2.
We wonder why Christ came into the world
And let men hurt him so,
We wonder why the Christ should have to die,
Does anybody know?
We wonder why! We wonder why!
The Son of God as man came down,
What does this signify?

We're traveling home to Heaven above,

Their trials and their labors o'er,
And yet there's room for millions more,
Will you go?

In rapturous songs to praise his name,

Will you go?

The way to Heaven is straight and plain,

Repent, believe, be born again,

Take up thy cross and follow me,
And thou shalt my salvation see,
Will you go?

O could I hear some sinner say:

Let me go!

The stream that from the fountain-head
Alone his thirst can slake.

My presence shall dispel.

And can it be that I should gain
An interest in the Saviour's blood?
Died he for me who caused his pain,
For me who him to death pursued?
Amazing love! how can it be
That thou, my God, shouldst die for me?
2.
He left his Father's throne above,
So free, so infinite his grace,
Emptied himself of all but love
And bled for Adam's helpless race.
'Tis mercy all, immense and free,
For, O my God, it found out me.
3.
Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and nature's night;
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray;
I woke; the dungeon flamed with light.
My chains fell off, my heart was free,
I rose, went forth, and followed thee.

No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in him, is mine.
Alive in him, my living head,
And clothed in righteousness divine,
Bold I approach the eternal throne
And claim the crown, through Christ, my own.

So fast to bar the gate!

And will ye treat me so?
O Lord, with shame and sorrow
We open now the door;

Out of my bondage, sorrow and night,
Jesus, I come, Jesus, I come;
Into thy freedom, gladness and light,

Out of my sickness into thy health,
Out of my want and into thy wealth,
Out of my sin and into thyself,

Out of distress to jubilant psalm,
Jesus, I come to thee.

Ever thy glorious face to behold,

Rock of ages, cleft for me
1.
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Cleanse me from its guilt and power.
2.
Not the labors of my hands
Can fulfil thy law's demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears for ever flow,
All for sin could not atone;
Thou must save, and thou alone.
3.
Nothing in my hand I bring,
Simply to thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to thee for dress,
Helpless, look to thee for grace,
Foul, I to the fountain fly;
Wash me, Saviour, or I die.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When mine eyes shall close in death,
When I soar to worlds unknown,
See thee on thy judgment throne,
Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in thee.

Saviour, hear me while before thy feet
1.
Saviour, hear me while before thy feet
I the record of my sins repeat.
Stained with guilt, myself abhorring,
Filled with grief, my soul outpouring;
Canst thou still in mercy think of me,
Stoop to set my shackled spirit free,
Raise my sinking heart and bid me be
Thy child once more?
Chorus
Grace there is my every debt to pay,
Blood to wash my every sin away,
Power to keep me spotless day by day,
For me, for me!
2.
All the memories of deeds gone by
Rise within me and thy power defy;
With a deathly chill ensnaring,
They would leave my soul despairing.
Saviour, take my hand, I cannot tell
How to stem the tides that round me swell,
How to ease my conscience, or to quell
My flaming heart.
3.
Yet why should I fear? Hast thou not died
That no seeking soul should be denied?
To that heart, its sins confessing,
Canst thou fail to give a blessing?
By the love and pity thou hast shown,
By the blood that did for me atone,
Boldly will I kneel before thy throne,
A pleading soul.
4.
All the rivers of thy grace I claim,
Over every promise write my name;
As I am I come, believing,
As thou art thou dost, receiving,
Bid me rise a free and pardoned slave,
Master o'er my sin, the world, the grave,
Charging me to preach thy power to save
To sinbound souls.

Before I found salvation

And from my Saviour wandered far astray;
But I came to Calvary's mountain,
And plunged into the fountain,
And from my heart the burden rolled way.

When Jesus from my heart did take
The load of sin that made it ache,
And filled my soul with joy.

And the devil's ranks deserted,
I've had such joy and gladness in my soul.
For Jesus I've been fighting,
And in the war delighting,
And now I'm pressing on toward the goal.

If faithful to my Saviour,
I shall enjoy his favor,
And he will keep me safely to the end;
And when I cross the river,
I'll live with him forever,
And one eternal day of glory spend.

How tasteless and tedious the hours
When Jesus no longer I see;
Sweet prospects, sweet birds and sweet flowers
Have lost all their sweetness to me.
The midsummer sun shines but dim,
The fields strive in vain to look gay;
But when I am happy in him
December's as pleasant as May.
2.
His name yields the richest perfume,
And sweeter than music his voice;
His presence disperses my gloom
And makes all within me rejoice.
I should, were he always thus nigh,
Have nothing to wish or to fear;
No mortal so happy as I,
My summer would last all the year.
3.
Content with beholding his face,
My all to his pleasure resigned,
No changes of season or place
Could make any change in my mind.
While blessed with a sense of his love,
A palace a toy would appear;
And prisons would palaces prove
If Jesus would dwell with me there.

Dear Lord, if indeed I am thine,
If thou art my sun and my song,

And why are my winters so long?

Or take me to thee up on high
Where winters and clouds are no more.

And the glory lingers near.

Can be seen in God the Son,
In the gentleness of Jesus
Love for all the world is shown.
Though men crucify their Saviour,
And his tenderness rebuff,
God is love, the cross is saying,
Calvary is proof enough.

I believe in transformation,
God can change the hearts of men,
And refine the evil nature
Till it glows with grace again.
Others may reject the weakling,
I believe he can be strong,
To the family of Jesus
All God's children may belong.
3.
In a world of shifting values,
There are standards that remain,
I believe that holy living
By God's grace we may attain.
All would hear the Holy Spirit
If they listen to his voice,
Every Christian may be Christlike
And in liberty rejoice.
4.
All the promises of Jesus
Are unchanged in every way,
In my yesterdays I proved them,
I believe them for today.
Still God gives his willing servant
Full equipment for the task;
Power is found by those who seek it,
Grace is given to those who ask.

When my eyes were dimmed with tears;

There were tokens of his light.

Peace amid the tempest's roar;

Brought me from the verge of Hell;

Sick was I, he made me well.

When a-wearied of the strife;
I was erring, and he sealed me,
Dead, his Spirit gave me life.

By his life's blood he has claimed me
As a jewel in his sight;
As his own child he has named me,
Brought me forth to walk in light.

Walking in the path he trod;
And I care not what befalls me
Living in the life of God.

Hope has dropped her anchor, found her rest
In the calm, sure haven of his breast;

Who did for me salvation bring,
And while I've breath I mean to sing:

In pining sickness or in health,
Christ for me.
In deepest poverty or wealth,

And in that all-important day,
When I the summons must obey,
And pass from this dark world away,

Where'er I speak, or sing, or pray,

My hope, my solace, and my song,
I'll send the ringing cry along:
Christ for me.

Above earth's lamentation
I hear the sweet though far-off hymn
That hails a new creation.
Through all the tumult and the strife
I hear the music ringing;
It finds an echo in my soul;
How can I keep from singing?

What though my joys and comforts die,
The Lord, my Saviour, liveth!
What though the darkness gather round,
Songs in the night he giveth!
No storm can shake my inmost calm
While to that refuge clinging;
Since Christ is Lord of Heaven and earth
How can I keep from singing?
3.
I lift mine eyes, the cloud grows thin,
I see the blue above it;
And day by day this pathway smooths
Since first I learned to love it.
The peace of Christ makes fresh my heart,
A fountain ever springing;
All things are mine since I am his;
How can I keep from singing?

And the burden of my heart rolled away;
It was there, by faith, I received my sight,
And now I am happy all the day.

That no power could have wrought
Such a marvel of wonder and might;
But 'twas done, for I felt,
At the cross as I knelt,
That my darkness was turned into light.

Then the gloom had all passed,
And, rejoicing at last,
I was sure that my soul was made right;
For my Lord, I could see,
In his love died for me
On the cross, where I first saw the light.

Owning my weaknesses and my despair;
Failure I cannot hide,
Broken my selfish pride,
Pardon thou dost provide,
Pardon declare.
2.
Nothing can I achieve, nothing attain;
He that without thee builds, labors in vain;
Shatter my own design,
Shaping a plan divine,
Come to this heart of mine,
Saviour, again.
3.
Though few the gifts I have that thou canst use,
Make thy demands on me; I'll not refuse;
Take all there is of me,
Take what I hope to be;
Thy way at last I see,
Thy way I choose.

Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom
1.
Lead, kindly Light, amid the encircling gloom,
Lead thou me on!
The night is dark, and I am far from home;
Lead thou me on!
Keep thou my feet; I do not ask to see
The distant scene: one step enough for me.
2.
I was not ever thus, nor prayed that thou
Shouldst lead me on.
I loved to choose and see my path; but now
Lead thou me on!
I loved the garish day and, spite of fears,
Pride ruled my will: remember not past years.
3.
So long thy power hath blest me, sure it still
Will lead me on
O'er moor and fen, o'er crag and torrent, till
The night is gone;
And with the morn those angel faces smile
Which I have loved long since, and lost awhile.

Lead us, heavenly Father, lead us
O'er the world's tempestuous sea;
Guard us, guide us, keep us, feed us,
For we have no help but thee,
Yet possessing every blessing
If our God our Father be.
2.
Saviour. breathe forgiveness o'er us;
All our weakness thou dost know;
Thou didst tread this earth before us;
Thou didst feel its keenest woe;
Lone and dreary, faint and weary,
Through the desert thou didst go.
3.
Spirit of our God, descending,
Fill our hearts with heavenly joy,
Love with every passion blending,
Pleasure that can never cloy;
Thus provided, pardoned, guided,
Nothing can our peace destroy.

With frank and unaverted eye!

And tell me all thou findest there!

The man who walked by Galilee.

And if thy judgments make me quail
And give me cause for grief and pain,
Yet shall thy love uphold me still
And bid my spirit rise again;

The task that thou to me hast given,
Let me my covenant renew
And bring a worthier gift to Heaven.

Prayer is the soul's sincere desire
1.
Prayer is the soul's sincere desire
Uttered or unexpressed,
The motion of a hidden fire
That trembles in the breast.
2.
Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
The falling of a tear,
The upward glancing of an eye
When none but God is near.
3.
Prayer is the simplest form of speech
That infant lips can try;
Prayer the sublimest strains that reach
The majesty on high.
4.
Prayer is the contrite sinner's voice
Returning from his ways,
While angels in their songs rejoice
And cry: Behold, he prays!
5.
Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,
The Christian's native air,
His watchword at the gates of death;
He enters Heaven with prayer.

The life, the truth, the way!
The path of prayer thyself hast trod:

Thou Lamb of God. whose precious blood
For every guilty sinner flows,
A cleansing, efficacious flood,
A healing stream for human woes,
Now let us feel its quickening power,
O cleanse our souls this very hour!

Assembled here with one accord,
We claim thy promised blessing now,
And dare believe thy precious word
While humbly at thy throne we bow.
O fill us with thy mighty power,
And save, O Lord, this very hour!

O solemnize each waiting heart,
And let us feel thy presence now
Subdue, dear Lord, the stubborn heart,
That all in penitence may bow.
Convict us by thy mighty power,
And save, dear Lord, this very hour.

Thou Shepherd of Israel, and mine
1.
Thou Shepherd of Israel, and mine,
The joy and desire of my heart,
For closer communion I pine,
I long to reside where thou art.
The pastures I languish to find
Where all who their shepherd obey
Are fed, on thy bosom reclined,
And screened from the heat of the day.
2.
Ah show me that happiest place,
The place of thy people's abode,
Where saints in true happiness gaze
And hang on a crucified God.
Thy love for a sinner declare,
Thy passion and death on the tree;
My spirit to Calvary bear,
To suffer and triumph with thee.
3.
'Tis there, with the lambs of thy flock,
There only, I covet to rest,
To lie at the foot of the rock,
Or rise to be hid in thy breast.
'Tis there I would always abide,
And never a moment depart,
Concealed in the cleft of thy side,
Eternally held in thy heart.

To God be the glory, a Saviour is mine

To God be the glory, a Saviour is mine,
Whose power is almighty. whose grace is divine;
My heart he hath cleansed, he is dwelling within,
So wondrously saving from sinning and sin.

O wonder of wonders, to God be the praise,
I joy in his will, I delight in his ways!
And through every conflict, without and within,
He saves me and keeps me from sinning and sin.

My Master to serve in the way he shall choose;
To work or to witness, to go or remain,
His smile of approval my infinite gain.

Earth's pleasures and treasures no longer allure,
My spirit aspires to the things which endure;
To walk with my Saviour in garments of white,
My highest ambition, my constant delight.

I worship the Lord in the light of his face;
So with him communing, like him I shall grow,
And life everlasting enjoy here below.

Everything to God in prayer!

O what needless pain we bear,

Everything to God in prayer!

Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful,
Who will all our sorrows share?

Are we weak and heavy laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Saviour, still our refuge:

Abide with me; fast falls the eventide

Abide with me; fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!
When other helpers fail, and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, O abide with me!
2.
Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
O thou who changest not, abide with me!
3.
I need thy presence every passing hour;
What but thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who like thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, O abide with me!
4.
I fear no foe, with thee at hand to bless;
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness.
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still if thou abide with me.
5.
Hold thou thy cross before my closing eyes;
Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies;
Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows flee;
In life, in death, O Lord, abide with me

With one accord our parting hymn of praise;

Have I walked worthily in work and play
Lightened my brother's load,
Walking life's toilsome road,

Abide with me when night is nigh,

Have spurned today the voice divine,
Now, Lord, the gracious work begin;

Mending their nets by the silvery sea,
The fishermen toiled at their tasks each day,
Till the Master walked along that way.

Follow thou me, he calls again,
And I will make you fishers of men;
As in the days by Galilee,
Jesus is calling you and me.

Making the Master's call their choice;
And they toiled with him for the world astray,
To bring men back to the Father's way.

Calling to men in the self-same way

Storm the forts of darkness, bring them down!
Glory, honor to the Lamb,
Praise and power to the Lamb,
Glory, honor, praise and power,
Be forever to the Lamb!

Soldiers of the cross, arise
1.
Soldiers of the cross, arise,
Gird you with your armor bright;
Mighty are your enemies,
Hard the battle ye must fight.
2.
O'er a faithless, fallen world
Raise your banner in the sky;
Let it float there wide unfurled;
Bear it onward; lift it high.
3.
'Mid the homes of want and woe,
Strangers to the living word,
Let the Saviour's herald go,
Let the voice of hope be heard.
4.
Where the shadows deepest lie,
Carry truth's unsullied ray;
Where are crimes of blackest dye,
There the saving sign display.
5.
To the weary and the worn
Tell of realms where sorrows cease;
To the outcast and forlorn
Speak of mercy and of peace.
6.
Be the banner still unfurled,
Still unsheathed the Spirit's sword,
Till the kingdoms of the world
Are the Kingdom of the Lord.

Where duty calls or danger,
Be never wanting there.

To the ends of the earth we will go;
And the Saviour's love will be the theme of our song
Because we love him so.

to lead our mighty throng,
Join the fight for the right,
in his everlasting might,

Who follows in their train?

As to the war we go.

Upon a lonely height,
Reveals God's sword to everyone,
A cross of love and light.

His Kingdom cometh not by force
But, by the gentle power
Of righteousness and truth and grace,
He triumphs every hour.
Sometimes his happy people march
With banners floating high,
Though often in secluded ways,
They fight that self may die.

The good fight is the fight of faith,
Heaven's victories are won
By men unarmed, save with the mind
That was in Christ, the Son.

So truth shall sin o'erthrow,
And love at last shall vanquish hate
As sunshine melts the snow.

As the varied way of life we journey
1.
As the varied way of life we journey,
Come the plains and then the mountainside,
Come the days of joy when birds are singing,
And the world is fair and sweet and wide;
Then a deeper joy comes, overfilling,
From the everlasting throne of love,
And all other joy is but an echo
From the ever-blessed heights above.
2.
There are shadows on the earthly pathway
Where, at times uncertainly, we tread;
In perplexity we halt and linger
Till our faith again is upward led.
For the heights of truth are ever calling,
And celestial radiance from afar
On our pilgrim way is gently falling
For our comfort where the shadows are.
3.
In the days of peace and golden sunshine,
In the days of joy. or days of woe,
There is confidence in him who holds us;
There is light to guide us here below.
And beyond await the heights of rapture
Where all earthly joys, transcended, fade
In the glory of the Saviour's presence,
In the home eternal he has made.

Have we not known it, have we not heard it
1.
Have we not known it, have we not heard it?
Power unto God belongs.
Yet do we daily find in his mercy
Themes for the sweetest songs;
Healing the wounded, raising the fallen,
Making the blind to see,
Saying to all who seek his face
These precious words of redeeming grace:
Chorus
No more! No more! He remembers sins no more,
They are pardoned for ever, And he will never
Bring them up against me any more.
I'll hear no more
Of the evil days of yore;
I'm a pardoned offender,
And God will remember them no more.
2.
Joy-bursts of singing gaily are springing
With every day that starts;
If we were silent then would the stones cry
Shame on our fainting hearts.
O banish sadness, sing now for gladness
Glory in Christ, the Lord!
Who is a God like unto thee,
One who can pardon iniquity?
3.
Safe in the dark day; safe in the bright day;
Safe till my latest breath;
There is endurance in this assurance,
Stronger than fear of death.
When the accuser comes to the judgment,
Seeking my soul to claim,
I have a token in the blood.
I have the word of a pardoning God.

 - Faith and trust
Chorus
No more! No more! He remembers sins no more,
They are pardoned for ever, And he will never
Bring them up against me any more.
I'll hear no more
Of the evil days of yore;
I'm a pardoned offender,
And God will remember them no more.

O words with heavenly comfort fraught!
Whate'er I do, where'er I be,
Still 'tis God's hand that leadeth me.
Chorus
He leadeth me, he leadeth me!
By his own hand he leadeth me;
His faithful follower I will be,
For by his hand he leadeth me.

Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom,
Sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,
By waters still, o'er troubled sea,
Still 'tis his hand that leadeth me.
3.
Lord, I would clasp thy hand in mine,
Nor ever murmur or repine,
Content, whatever lot I see,
Since 'tis my God that leadeth me.

When by thy grace the victory's won,
E'en death's cold wave I will not flee,
Since God through Jordan leadeth me.

Hold thou my hand! so weak I am, and helpless

Hold thou my hand! so weak I am, and helpless,
I dare not take one step without thy aid;
Hold thou my hand! for then, O loving Saviour,
No dread of ill shall make my soul afraid.
2.
Hold thou my hand! and closer, closer draw me
To thy dear self, my hope, my joy, my all;
Hold thou my hand, lest haply I should wander,
And, missing thee, my trembling feet should fall.
3.
Hold thou my hand! the way is dark before me
Without the sunlight of thy face divine;
But when by faith I catch its radiant glory,
What heights of joy, what rapturous songs are mine.
4.
Hold thou my hand! that when I reach the margin
Of that lone river thou didst cross for me,
A heavenly light may flash across its waters,
And every wave like crystal bright shall be.

I dwell within the secret place
1.
I dwell within the secret place
Where refuge from my foes I find;
And leaving cumbering cares with him
Ensures for me an even mind.
The guest of God! O thought sublime,
That he my host should be through time!
2.
While in his dwelling place I stay,
A favored and contented guest,
His angels hold a charge divine
To keep my feet in ways of rest.
The guest of God! What ecstasy
That I should share his sanctuary!
3.
No fears can wake my darkest nights,
No clouds can spoil my brightest days;
While sheltering 'neath his holy roof
His guardian care evokes my praise.
The guest of God, below, above!
My life surrounded is by love!

But more is he than host to me
And I am more to him than guest;
He is my Saviour and my friend,
Eternal love made manifest.
The guest of God! Such happiness
My simple tongue fails to express!

But I know whom I have believed,

The God I serve is one who cares and understands.
Although the storms I face would threaten to confound me,
Of this I am assured: I'm in his hands.

When I have yielded to the law of love's demands;
Why should I doubt that he would evermore be present

Where the dark clouds have been.

Like to a lamb who from the fold has strayed
Far on the mountain, of the dark afraid,
Seeking a shelter from the night's alarm,
Longing for comfort of the shepherd's arm,
So Jesus found me on sin's mountain drear,
Gathered me close and banished all my fear.
Chorus
In the Love of Jesus there is all I need,
While I follow closely where my Lord may lead;
By his grace forgiven,
In his presence blest,

While I follow closely where my Lord may lead;

Seeking the comfort of a guiding hand,
Fearing the perils of the winding way,
Pleading for strength sufficient every day,

3.
Like to a child who, when the night may fall,
Out of the darkness hears his father call,
Far and a-weary though his feet may roam,
Sees in the distance shining lights of home,
So at the last the music of his voice
Will calm my fears and make my heart rejoice.

The cross that he gave may be heavy

The cross that he gave may be heavy,
But it ne'er outweighs his grace;
The storm that I feared may surround me,
But it ne'er excludes his face.
Chorus
The cross is not greater than his grace,
The storm cannot hide his blessed face;
I am satisfied to know, that with Jesus here below,
I can conquer every foe.
2.
The thorns in my path are not sharper
Than composed his crown for me;
The cup which I drink not more bitter
Than he drank in Gethsemane.
3.
The scorn of my foes may be daring,
For they scoffed and mocked my God;
They'll hate me for my holy living,
For they crucified my Lord.

As it falls on paths of woe;
The toil of my work will grow lighter

Those first disciples of the Lord
1.
Those first disciples of the Lord
Received the promise of his word
And in their lives such power did dwell
To speed the message they should tell
To all mankind, that Jesus lives,
And grace to each believer gives;
May that same grace inspire today
To live for Christ, the life and way.
2.
Revival is our present need,
And can be ours if we will heed
That promise ratified by grace,
Declared in Christ for every race;
For power from God is very sure
To men of faith who will endure,
And love will triumph over sin
To bring God's glorious Kingdom in.
3.
The powers of evil long have sought
To ruin man in deed and thought;
His longings for the true and good
Have been frustrated, though he would
Desire to conquer; yet we know
God wills, indeed, this should be so.
The promise now we may receive;
'Tis sure for all who dare believe.
4.
Our deeds must ever match our creed,
Then God our way will truly lead
As when those first disciples heard
And boldly trusted God's great word.
If we believed as they believed,
Great grace would hallow every deed,
Light would be ours his truth to know
And send us forth his love to show.

Frail am I, but thou art my befriender,
And I trust the shining of thy face.

So I long for thee, the living God;
To the spring that flows from out the mountain,
Lead me forth with thine unerring rod.
From the depths my soul has called upon thee,
From the hill shall make thy praises known,
For my foes shall not prevail upon me,
By thy strength shall they be overthrown.

By thy loving-kindness so unfailing,
Never once hast thou forsaken me;
O for grace that I, by prayer prevailing,
May in faithful love remember thee!

Renders up the sacrifice of praise;
Place thy hand upon me for my sealing,
Thine alone, throughout my length of days.

But faith makes us bold;
For though we are strangers,

And trust, in all dangers,

Or goodness we claim;
Yet, since we have known

In this our strong tower
For safety we hide,

And human feet stand on it;
Only faith, in mystic flight,

Steeper than the mountains of time,
Higher than the loftiest climb,

From thence my help is coming.

To the hills I'll turn again,
Away from earthly slumber,
There to gain the topmost plain;

The flag is yours, the flag is mine,
That flies o'er lands and seas;

That brings new life, new hope, new joy,
And tells of victory.

They bid me choose an easier path
1.
They bid me choose an easier path,
And seek a lighter cross;
Thy bid me mingle with Heaven's gold
A little of earth's dross;
They bid me, but in vain, once more
The world's illusions try;
I cannot leave the dear old flag,
'Twere better far to die.
2.
They say the fighting is too hard,
My strength of small avail,
When foes beset and friends are fled,
My faith must surely fail.
But, O how can I quit my post
While millions sin-bound lie?
I cannot leave the dear old flag,
'Twere better far to die.
3.
They say I can a Christian be,
And serve God quite as well,
And reach Heaven just as surely by
The music of church bell;
But, O the drum and clarion call
Of band make my pulse fly!
I cannot leave the dear old flag,
'Twere better far to die.
4.
I answer, life is fleeting fast,
I cannot, cannot wait;
For me my comrades beckoning stand
Beyond the pearly gate;

I hear their battle cry:
O do not leave the dear old flag,
'Twere better far to die!

When you find the cross is heavy,
And you feel like giving in,

Countless hosts he leads to victory,
He will do the same for you.

As you tread the narrow way,
When they spurn or misinterpret
All the kindly words you say,

From the paths of sin and shame,
Pointing them unto the Saviour
Who for sinners once was slain.

You will find that trusting Jesus
Makes your daily pathway bright,
And the glory of believing
Turns your darkness into light;
There's a gladness which increases
As to serve him you aspire,
And a peace which comes with trusting
When his will is your desire.

I think, when I read that sweet story of old,
When Jesus was here among men,
How he called little children as lambs to his fold,
I should like to have been with them then.
I wish that his hands had been placed on my head,
That his arm had been thrown around me,
And that I might have seen his kind look when he said:
Let the little ones come unto me!
2.
Yet still to his footstool in prayer I may go,
And ask for a share in his love;
And if I now earnestly seek him below,
I shall see him and hear him above,
In that beautiful place he is gone to prepare
For all who are washed and forgiven;
And many dear children are gathering there,
For of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.
3.
But thousands and thousands who wander and fall
Never heard of that heavenly home;
I should like them to know there is room for them all,
And that Jesus has bid them to come.
I long for the joys of that glorious time,
The sweetest and brightest and best,
When the dear little children of every clime
Shall crowd to his arms and be blessed.

In the fight, say, does your heart grow weary
1.
In the fight, say, does your heart grow weary?
Do you find your path is rough and thorny,
And above the sky is dark and stormy?
Never mind, go on!
Lay aside all fear, and onward pressing,
Bravely fight and God will give his blessing;
Though the war at times may prove distressing,
Never mind, go on!
Chorus
When the road we tread is rough,
Let us bear in mind,
In our Saviour strength enough
We may always find;
Though the fighting may be tough
Let our motto be:
Go on, go on to victory!
2.
Faithful be, delaying not to follow
Where Christ leads, though it may be through sorrow;
If the strife should fiercer grow tomorrow,
Never mind, go on!
Cheerful be, it will your burdens lighten,
One glad heart will always others brighten;
Though the strife the coward's soul may frighten,
Never mind, go on!
3.
When downhearted, look away to Jesus,
Who for you did shed his blood most precious;
Let us say, though all the world should hate us:
Never mind, go on!
Do your best in fighting for your Saviour,
For his sake fear not to lose men's favor;
If beside you should a comrade waver,
Never mind, go on!

When the road we tread is rough,

I've found the secret of success
1.
I've found the secret of success,
'Tis holding on, 'tis holding on;
The way to every blessedness,
'Tis holding on, 'tis holding on.
Our warfare may be hard and fierce,
Oft Satan's arrows wound and pierce,
But still we get more smiles than tears
By holding on, by holding on.
2.
Have you your fighting just begun?
Keep holding on, keep holding on;
The hardest battles have been won
By holding on, by holding on.
Though you may meet with runaways
Who mourn their weakness half their days,
Yet you can gain eternal praise
By holding on, by holding on.
3.
If full salvation you would gain,
Keep holding on, keep holding on;
To conquer sins that bring you pain,
Keep holding on, keeping holding on.
God loves to give the better part,
Not unto those who only start,
But those who seek with all their heart,
And then in faith keep holding on.

Tell them how to find the sweetest rest
Leaning on the loving Saviour's breast.
Tell them all about the dear old book,
Tell them there is life just for a look;
Let this banner be unfurled:
Christ for the whole wide world.
Chorus
Tell them of the baby in the manger laid,
Sent from Heaven above;
Tell them how for them he was a ransom paid,
Just because of love.
Tell them with your lips and by your actions too,
And with flag unfurled,
Tell it out with a shout, tell it out with a shout:
Christ for the whole wide world.
2.
To the beat of Army drums, make known
That the Saviour-King has sin o'erthrown;
Tell the rich and poor, the sad and lone,
Till his power to everyone is shown.
Tell it to the people you may meet,
Tell it in the hall and in the street;
Let this banner be unfurled:
Christ for the whole wide world.

Tell it to the young and to the old,
Tell them they may all be warriors bold,
Tell them of the shepherd and the fold,
Tell them of the heavenly harps of gold.
Tell it with a clarion voice so clear,
Let the story ring out far and near,
Let this banner be unfurled:
Christ for the whole wide world.

The world for God! The world for God
1.
The world for God! The world for God!
There's nothing else will meet the hunger of my soul.
I see forsaken children, I see the tears that fall
From women's eyes, once merry, now never laugh at all;
I see the sins and sorrows of those who sit in darkness;
I see in lands far distant, the hungry and oppressed.
But behold! On a hill, Calvary! Calvary!
Chorus

I give my heart! I'll do my part!

I call to arms the soldiers of the blood and fire:
Go with the Holy Bible. Its words are peace and life
To multitudes who struggle with crime and want and strife.
Go with your songs of mercy, show Christ in loving kindness,
Make known the sufferings of the cross, the sacrifice of God;
For behold! On a hill, Calvary! Calvary!
3.
The world for God! The world for God!
For this, dear Lord, give to my soul consuming fire.
Give fire that makes men heroes, turns weakness into might,
The fire that gives the courage to suffer for the fight,
The fire that changes fearing to pentecostal daring,
The fire that makes me willing for Christ to live or die;
For behold! On a hill, Calvary! Calvary!

Where men seldom hear his name;
For to bind the brokenhearted
And their liberty proclaim,

In the highways, in the byways,
And in lands beyond the sea,

In the lands beyond the sea,
Where the millions bound by evil
Have no hope of liberty;
As we tell the gospel tidings,
Lo! the captives are set free;
We are witnesses for Jesus
In the lands beyond the sea.
3.
We are witnesses for Jesus
In the home and in the mart,
Where the cares of life and fashion
Crowd the Saviour from the heart;
When we urge his claims with wisdom
Many choose the better part;
We are witnesses for Jesus
In the home and in the mart.

We have caught the vision splendid
Of a world which is to be,
When the pardoning love of Jesus
Freely flows from sea to sea,
When all men from strife and anger,
Greed and selfishness are free,
When the nations live together
In sweet peace and harmony.
2.
We would help to build the city
Of our God, so wondrous fair;
Give our time, bring all our talents,
And each gift of beauty rare,
Powers of mind, and strength of purpose,
Days of labor, nights of strain,
That God's will may be accomplished,
O'er the kingdoms he shall reign.
3.
Founded on the rock of ages,
Built upon God's promise sure,
Strengthened by the cords of service,
We shall stand firm and secure;
When the Father, Son and Spirit
Crown our labors with success,
Men and angels then uniting
Shall God's mighty love confess.

Hushed was the evening hymn,
1.
Hushed was the evening hymn,
The temple courts were dark,
The lamp was burning dim
Before the sacred ark;
When suddenly a voice divine
Rang through the silence of the shrine.
2.
The old man, meek and mild,
The priest of Israel, slept;
His watch the temple child,
The little Levite, kept;
And what from Eli's sense was sealed,
The Lord to Hannah's son revealed.
3.
O give me Samuel's ear,
The open ear, O Lord,
Alive and quick to hear
Each whisper of thy word;
Like him to answer at thy call
And to obey thee first of all.
4.
O give me Samuel's heart,
A lowly heart, that waits
Where in thy house thou art,
Or watches at thy gates
By day and night, a heart that still
Moves at the breathing of thy will.
5.
O give me Samuel's mind.
A sweet unmurmuring faith,
Obedient and resigned
To thee in life and death;
That I may read with childlike eyes
Truths that are hidden from the wise.

Which angel voices tell,
How once the King of Glory
Came down on earth to dwell
I am both weak and sinful,
But this I surely know:
The Lord came down to save me
Because he loved me so.
2.
I'm glad my blessed Saviour
Was once a child like me,
To show how pure and holy
His little ones might be;
And if I try to follow
His footsteps here below,
He never will forsake me
Because he loves me so.
3.
To sing his love and mercy
My sweetest songs I'll raise;
For though I cannot see him,
I know he hears my praise;
And mine his loving promise
That even I may go
To sing among the angels,
Because he loves me so.

Waving a branch of the palm tree

Of bitter pain;

For me was slain;

When, his salvation bringing,
To Zion Jesus came,
The children all stood singing
Hosanna to his name;
Nor did their zeal offend him,
But, as he rode along,
He bade them still attend him,
And smiled to hear their son.
2.
And since the Lord retaineth
His love for children still,
Though now as King he reigneth
On Zion's heavenly hill,
Well serve beneath his banner
Till victory s won,
And sing aloud: Hosanna
To David's royal Son!
3.
For should we fail proclaiming
Our great redeemer's praise,
The stones, our silence shaming,
Would their hosannas raise;
But shall we only render
The tribute of our words?

They, too, shall be the Lord's.

1.
Just as I am, thine own to be,
Friend of the young who lovest me,
To consecrate myself to thee,
O Jesus Christ, I come.

In the glad morning of my day,
My life to give, my vows to pay,
With no reserve, and no delay,
With all my heart, I come.
3.
Just as I am, young, strong and free,
To be the best that I can be
For truth and righteousness and thee,
Lord of my life, I come.
4.
With many dreams of fame and gold,
Success and joy to make me bold;
But dearer still my faith to hold,
For my whole life, I come.

And for thy sake to win renown,
And then to take my victor's crown,
And at thy feet to cast it down,
O Master, Lord, I come.

O Jesus, I have promised
1.
O Jesus, I have promised
To serve thee to the end,
Be thou for ever near me,
My Master and my friend.
I shall not fear the battle
If thou art by my side,
 Nor wander from the pathway,
If thou wilt be my guide.

O let me feel thee near me;
The world is ever near;
I see the sights that dazzle,
The tempting sounds I hear.
My foes are ever near me,
Around me and within;
But, Jesus, draw thou nearer
And shield my soul from sin.
3.
O let me hear thee speaking
In accents clear and still,
Above the storms of passion,
The murmurs of self-will.
O speak to reassure me,
To chasten or control;
O speak to make me listen,
Thou Guardian of my soul.
4.
O Jesus, thou hast promised
To all who follow thee,
That where thou art in Glory,
There shall thy servant be;
And, Jesus, I have promised
To serve thee to the end;
O give me grace to follow,
My Master and my friend.

Men's hearts grow faint through all the earth today;
Evil, with evil everywhere conferring,
Summons its legions forth in dread array.

Urgent, insistent sounds the voice divine;
Out in the darkness men are thickly falling;
Go with the cross, it is thy battle sign.

Forward, O youth! but first, in true submission,
Bring all thou hast and art to Christ, thy Lord;
Take from his hand his glorious commission,
Rise then, and in his name unsheathe thy sword.

Leaping the frontiers of a stricken world;
Strive till the foes of God are dashed to pieces,

Only do thou guide my way;

Gladly then shall I obey.

Shouldst thou take my life, or spare it,
I that life to thee resign.

May this solemn consecration
Never once forgotten be;

In noble deeds and worthy strife;

Brief is our journey through the years
1.
Brief is our journey through the years,
And fleeting are our longest days;
We cherish every laden hour
And linger o'er familiar ways;
For toil and grief, or joy and gain,
When blessed by God, are sanctified,
And friendships forged through serving him,
With each new test, are purified.
2.
Yet know we that the sun must set,
The darkness of the night draws near
When we, as all men, must obey
The voice inaudible, but clear,
That calls us from beyond the years,
Away from all we feel and see;
How shall we bear a last farewell,
O beauteous world, how part from thee?
3.
With Jesus' name upon their lips,
The vale of death his servants tread;
In him they dared believe; in him
They dare depart; nor sigh, nor dread;
To love committing all their loves,
All counted good through peace or strife,
Content to die believing still
In Jesus, everlasting life.

Where God is not O awful thought,
A realm deserted, cast aside,
With sin to full fruition brought
And evil crowned and deified;
Where dread remorse and vain desire
Burn like an unconsuming fire.
4.
God stoops from Heaven your soul to save,
He calls you now from Calvary;
What hope have you beyond the grave,
And who can give you hope but he?
Why longer in your sin remain?
For your redemption Christ was slain.

O think of the home over there

O think of the home over there,
By the side of the river of light,
Where the saints all immortal and fair
Are robed in their garments of white.
Chorus
Over there, over there, O think of the home over there.
Over there, over there, O think of the home over there.

O think of the friends over there,
Who before us the journey have trod;
Of the song that they breathe on the air
In their home in the palace of God.
3.
My Saviour is now over there,
Where my kindred and friends are at rest;
Then away from my sorrow and care
Let me fly to the land of the blest.

For the end of my journey I see;
Many dear to my heart over there
Are waiting and watching for me.

On Jordan's stormy banks I stand,
And cast a wistful eye
To Canaan's fair and happy land,
Where my possessions lie.

I am bound for the promised land

I am bound for the promised land.

That rises to my sight,
Sweet fields arrayed in living green,
And rivers of delight.

There generous fruits that never fail,
On trees immortal grow;
There rocky hills, and brooks and vales,
With milk and honey flow.
4.
O'er all those wide extended plains
Shines one eternal day;
There God, the Son, forever reigns
And scatters night away.

Soon will the Lord my soul prepare
For joys beyond the sky,
Where never-ceasing music rolls,
And praises never die.

Borne in a song to me

Over the jasper sea.

Break on the golden shore.

Servant of God, well done
1.
Servant of God, well done!
Rest from thy loved employ;
The battle fought, the victory won,
Enter thy Master's joy.
2.
The heavenly summons came,
He started up to hear;
A mortal arrow pierced his frame,
He fell, but felt no fear.
3.
His spirit, with a bound,
Left its encumbering clay;
His tent, at sunrise, on the ground
A darkened ruin lay.
4.
The pains of death are past,
Labor and sorrow cease;
And, life's long warfare closed at last,
His soul is found in peace.

Soldier of Christ, well done!
Praise be thy new employ;
And while eternal ages run,
Rest in thy Saviour's joy.

Sins reproving, wants revealing,
While redeeming grace is flowing,

Of his great judgment throne!
3.
Ransomed sinners of all kinds,
Trembling followers as well,
With their robes surely blood-washed,

Of the battles fought bravely,
Of the victories won,
As they stand in the light
Of his great judgment throne.

Summoned home! the call has sounded
1.
Summoned home! the call has sounded
Bidding a soldier his warfare cease;
And the song of angels resounding
Welcomes a warrior to eternal peace.

A comrade has found release.

Conflicts and dangers are over;
See him honored at the throne of glory,
Crowned by the hand of Jehovah.

Strife and sorrow over,
The Lord's true faithful soldier
Has been called to go from the ranks below
To the conquering host above.

Once the sword, but now the scepter,
Once the fight, now the rest and fame;
Broken every earthly fetter,
Now the glory for the cross and shame;
Once the loss of all for Jesus,
But now the eternal gain.
Trials and sorrows here have now their meaning found,
Mysteries their explanation;
Safe forever in the sunlight gleaming
Of his eternal salvation.

And the life beyond decay;

There is no grief above;

Of his eternal love.

His mercy doth expand,

With mercy and with judgment
My web of time he wove,

When throned where glory dwelleth
In Immanuel's land.

There is a land of pure delight
1.
There is a land of pure delight,
Where saints immortal reign;
Infinite day excludes the night,
And pleasures banish pain.
There everlasting spring abides,
And never-withering flowers;
Death, like a narrow sea, divides
This heavenly land from ours.
2.
Sweet fields beyond the swelling flood
Stand dressed in living green;
So to the Jews old Canaan stood,
While Jordan rolled between.
But timorous mortals start and shrink
To cross this narrow sea.
And linger, shivering on the brink,
And fear to launch away.
3.
O could we make our doubts remove,
Those gloomy thoughts that rise,
And see the Canaan that we love
With unbeclouded eyes!
Could we but climb where Moses stood
And view the landscape o'er,
Not Jordan's stream, nor death's cold flood,
Could fright us from the shore.

Followers of the dying God.

Washed their robes by faith below
In the blood of yonder Lamb,
Blood that washes white as snow;

Serve their Master day and night;

Shall his saints forever feed,
With the tree of life sustain,
To the living fountains lead;

All their wants at once remove,
Wipe the tears from every face,
Fill up every soul with love.

You must have your sins forgiven
1.
You must have your sins forgiven,
Ere the sun, ere the sun goes down,
If you wish to go to Heaven
When the sun, when the sun goes down.
O now to God be crying,
For your time is swiftly flying,
In the grave you'll soon be lying
When the sun goes down!
Chorus
Ere the sun, ere the sun goes down,
Ere the sun, ere the sun goes down,
O sinner, come to Jesus
Ere the sun goes down!
2.
Every chance will soon be past,
When the sun, when the sun goes down;
Even this may be the last,
When the sun, when the sun goes down.
If this offer be rejected,
And salvation still neglected,
Death may come when least expected,
When the sun goes down.

And are we yet alive

And are we yet alive,
And see each other's face?
Glory and praise to Jesus give
For his redeeming grace!
Preserved by power divine
To full salvation here,
Again in Jesus' praise we join,
And in his sight appear.
2.
What troubles we have seen,
What conflicts we have passed,
Fightings without and fears within,
Since we assembled last
But out of all the Lord
Has brought us by his love;
And still he doth his help afford,
And hides our life above.
3.
Then let us make our boast
Of his redeeming power,
Which saves us to the uttermost,
Till we shall sin no more.
Let us take up the cross,
Till we the crown obtain,
And gladly reckon all things loss,
So we may Jesus gain.

Father, let me dedicate,

In whatever worldly state

Would I ask that thou shouldst spare;
This alone shall be my prayer,

Joys that yet are mine,

Let my glad heart, while it sings,
Rise by faith's exultant wings,
And, whate'er the future brings,
Glorify thy name.

If thou callest to the cross,
And its shadow come
Turning all my gain to loss,
Shrouding heart and home,
Let me think how thy dear Son
His eternal glory won,
And in steadfast faith pray on:
Glorify thy name.

We as faithful soldiers keep;
By our consecrated giving
Wider fields our comrades reap.
Souls in darkness yet are calling,
Come and help us, still they cry;
With our gifts our hearts outpouring,
We will help them lest they die.

Laying now our gifts before thee,
We toward thine altar move;
Lord, accept these simple tokens
Of our deep, unswerving love.
None can estimate their measure
When within thy hands they lie;
All that we sincerely offer

Naught we hold save by surrender;
Nothing keep but that we give;
Loving life too much, we lose it;
Dead to self, we truly live.

Gain is found through sacrifice;
For thy gift of life eternal
Thou didst pay love's greatest price.

At harvest time our eyes behold
1.
At harvest time our eyes behold
Full sheaves of ripened grain,
But whence have come these fields of gold
To beautify the plain?
Ere man could reap the rich supply
Which meets a country's need,
Into the ready ground to die
There fell the tiny seed.
2.
Through storm and rain, 'neath darkening skies,
After the seed is sown,
Deep buried in the earth it lies,
Abiding yet alone;
And men the precious fruits await,
Long patience follows toil,
Before the harvest rich and great
Bursts from the furrowed soil.
3.
O in the morning sow thy seed,
At eve stay not thy hand;
Though tears may fall, and hearts may bleed
Obey thy Lord's command.
Part with thy best; unless it die
It must abide alone;
But God is pledged to multiply
Seed for his Kingdom sown.

Wholesome grain and pure may be!

From his field shall in that day
All offenses purge away,
Give his angels charge at last
In the fire the tares to cast,
But the fruitful ears to store
In his garner evermore.

Even so, Lord, quickly come,
Bring thy final harvest home;
Gather thou thy people in,

Raise the glorious harvest home!

The hills leap up in gladness.

All things with large increase;

O God of love eternal,
Be present here we pray,
Accept the gift we offer
This celebration day,
Make of this place your temple,
Let all who enter here
Be one with us in purpose,
Your love and joy to share.
2.
Except you build the house, Lord,
Our work is all in vain,
Except your Spirit fill it
But blocks of stone remain;
But if our hearts are open
And you in power come down.
The glory of your presence
Will all our labors crown.
3.
Here may the lost find refuge,
The striving saint find grace;
Let youth obey your calling
And children see your face;
May every word here spoken
Direct men to your throne,
And every note of music
Be for your praise alone.
4.
Then sanctify, our Father,
This offering we have made,
Here let your Son be honored,
Your Spirit be obeyed;
Our lives be cleansed for service
In Christ's atoning blood,
And every true believer
Become the house of God.

O Lord,, regard thy people
1.
O Lord,, regard thy people,
Whose love designs to frame
This house of glad remembrance,
And here inscribe thy name.
To thee, the sure foundation,
Our witness would we raise,
Her walls to speak salvation,
Her gates to tell thy praise.
2.
We thank thee for our birthright,
Secured at such a price;
Forbid that we despise it,
Or shrink from sacrifice.
Inspire our hearts to serve thee,
Thy chosen path to tread,
That we may follow boldly
Where nobler hearts have led.

And dying sinners pray to live,
Hear thou in Heaven, thy dwelling place,
And when thou hearest, Lord, forgive.

The blessed gospel of thy Son.
Still, by the power of his great name,
Be mighty signs and wonders done.

Yet choose not, Lord, this house alone;
Thy Kingdom come to every heart,
In every nation fix thy throne.

1.
O God of love, to thee we bow,
And pray for these before thee now,
That, closely knit in holy vow,
They may in thee be one.

When days are filled with pure delight,
When paths are plain and skies are bright,
Walking by faith and not by sight,
May they in thee be one.

When stormy winds fulfil thy will,
And all their good seems turned to ill,
Then, trusting thee completely, still
May they in thee be one.

Whate'er in life shall be their share
Of quickening joy or burdening care,
In power to do and grace to bear,
May they in thee be one.

O perfect Love, all human thought transcending,
Lowly we kneel in prayer before thy throne,
That theirs may be the love which knows no ending,
Throughout their life divinely joined in one.
2.
O perfect Life, be thou their full assurance
Of tender charity and steadfast faith,
Of patient hope, and quiet brave endurance,
With childlike trust that fears nor pain nor death.

Grant them the joy which brightens earthly sorrow,
Grant them the peace which calms all earthly strife;
And to life's day the glorious unknown morrow
That dawns upon eternal love and life.

In thine eternal bands.

The hallowed path they trace.

With Christ's own bride they rise,
And cast their crowns before thee
In endless Paradise.

Christ is alive! Let Christians sing
1.
Christ is alive! Let Christians sing.
His cross stands empty to the sky.
Let streets and homes with praises ring.
His love in death shall never die.

Christ is alive! No longer bound
To distant years in Palestine,
He comes to claim the hear and now
And conquer ev'ry place and time.
3.
Not throned above, remotely high,
Untouched, unmoved by human pains,
But daily, in the midst of life,
Our Saviour with the Father reigns.
4.
In ev'ry insult, rift and war,
Where color, scorn or wealth divide,
He suffers still, yet loves the more,
And lives, though ever crucified.
5.
Christ is alive! His Spirit burns
Through this and ev'ry future age,
Till all creation lives and learns
His joy, his justice, love and praise.
